WE JOIN TOGETHER HERE TODAY,
TO HELP TWO PEOPLE ON THEIR WAY,
AS LEAH AND CHRIS START THEIR LIFE TOGETHER,
AND NOW WE'VE REACHED THEIR SPECIAL DATE,
WE'VE COME TO HELP THEM CELEBRATE,
AND SHOW THEM HOW MUCH WE LOVE THEM TOO,
HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH,
AS LEAH IS WALKING UP THE AISLE,
AND CHRIS LOOKS UP AND GIVES A SMILE,
THE LOVE THAT FLOWS BETWEEN THEM FILLS THE CHURCH,
WITH LEAH'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY ON HER SIDE,
SHE REALLY IS THE BLUSHING BRIDE,
WITH LOVE AND PRIDE THEY LEAD HER
HALLELUJAH,
HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH,
WITH THE PRIEST AND THE FAMILY WHO LEAD THE PRAYERS,
WE SAY OUR LINES AND THEY SAY THEIRS,
I GUIDE THEM THROUGH THE CEREMONY,
AND IN THIS HOUSE OF GOD ABOVE,
THEY JOIN THEIR HANDS TO SHOW THEIR LOVE,
AND SAY THOSE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS THAT YOU HEARD,
HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH,
HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH,
HALLELUJAH,
HALLELUJAH.
